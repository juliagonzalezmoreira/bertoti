"We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth."

üí°O texto destaca tr√™s diferen√ßas principais entre programa√ß√£o e engenharia de software: tempo e mudan√ßas futuras, escala e efici√™ncia, e a complexidade de decis√µes com impacto significativo. Em resumo, a engenharia de software vai al√©m da simples programa√ß√£o, lidando com preocupa√ß√µes mais amplas para garantir o sucesso a longo prazo.

"Within Google, we sometimes say, ‚ÄúSoftware engineering is programming integrated over time.‚Äù Programming is certainly a significant part of software engineering: after all, programming is how you generate new software in the first place. If you accept this distinction, it also becomes clear that we might need to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance). The addition of time adds an important new dimension to programming. Cubes aren‚Äôt squares, distance isn‚Äôt velocity. Software engineering isn‚Äôt programming."

üí° O texto destaca a vis√£o de que a engenharia de software √© um campo mais abrangente que incorpora programa√ß√£o, mas vai al√©m dela, exigindo habilidades e considera√ß√µes adicionais ao longo do tempo para garantir o sucesso cont√≠nuo e a evolu√ß√£o do software.
